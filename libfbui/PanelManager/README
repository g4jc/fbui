Frame Buffer Panel Manager (fbpm)

The panel manager is an approach to organizing windows
based on my own personal usage patterns, more or less.

Accelerator keys:

alt-<number key> to flip to a specific windows.
alt-Tab to flip to the next app window.
alt-Backspace to exit, killing all windows and
	their processes.

Eventually I will add the ability to divide the main area
between two or three applications, especially since
the concept of an 'ephemeral' application such as a 
calculator or to-do list requires that.

Note, the "title bar" is purely ornamental and nonfunctional.
