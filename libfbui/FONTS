FBUI currently uses PCF fonts, which are a compiled version
of BDF fonts. X Windows also uses PCF fonts, so you should use
those that come with X. These derive from Adobe and although
they are not scaleable or anti-aliased, they do look good.

A typical directory in which one might find the PCF fonts
is /usr/X11/lib/fonts/75dpi however you may have to use
"find" to locate them, such as "find / -name 75dpi".

If the directory is not the exact one which libfbuifonts
expects to find them in, i.e. /usr/X11/lib/fonts/75dpi,
you can set the environment variable PCFFONTDIR to the
correct directory.

Comparison:

My PCF fonts reader:	29 kB
Freetype:		470 kB
The T1 library:		222 kB
TeX-based fonts:	~50 kB ??
