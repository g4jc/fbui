IMMEDIATE WORK
--------------

Version 0.11 of FBUI has some minor issues that I am
still working on, namely 
	- a bug in the removal of windows
	- a need to improve window move performance

FUTURE WORK
-----------

What sorts of ideas am I planning for FBUI and libfbui? 
Where is my list of features to add?

The fact that FBUI and libfbui are so small means that 
some features can yet be added very inexpensively.
The question is to which provide the most for the least
cost in code size and memory usage.

Personally I think FBUI is now very close to its maximum size,
but libfbui could use some work.

Here is my list of features I am contemplating
the addition of.

0. FBUI: "active" areas in windows to permit the wm to move/resize/etc.

1. FBUI: per-window settable mouse pointer and the ability to disable
   the mouse pointer.

2. libfbui: widgets... FLTK2?

3. libfbui: support for anti-aliased fonts, preferably
   very cheap ones like those available in TeX.
	Note:
		Freetype's .a is 470 kB
		T1lib's .a is 222 kB
	Whereas:
		My PCF font support is 29 kB
		A TeX font reader would be similarly small.

	-> NOTE, AA fonts are the most-asked-for feature.

4. FBUI driver: VGA (4bpp) support for use on pre-VESA systems.

5. FBUI: vertical blanking events?

6. FBUI: support for partially off-screen windows.

7. apps: proper Launch menu.

8. apps: fbwm support for resizing windows (moving is via Alt-M).

9. FBUI: add ability of wm to send "menu" commands to apps, 
   in case the wm is used as a menu system.

10. FBUI: integrated sound playing?

11. FBUI: move filled-triangle routine to libfbui.

12. libfbui: Unicode

Other:

*. fbcon: use of FBUI's putimage routines to implement
           an anti-aliased console font.

---------------------

Applications still needed:

* FBUI version of xine frontend.

* pdf viewer

* basic document editor a la simpletext or wordpad.
 
* web browser... Dillo or links based.

* email reader/composer

---------------------

Older list

* fbpm: implement support for Ephemeral apps

* implement 16-bit fonts? add support for Unicode
